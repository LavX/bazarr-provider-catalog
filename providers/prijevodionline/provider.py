"""Prijevodi-Online provider for the Bazarr+ Provider Hub catalog.

The site relaunched in September 2026 as a browser app backed by a JSON API at
https://www.prijevodi-online.org/api/v1/, and this provider talks to that API
only. The old HTML routes now redirect to the app shell.

It works without an account: search always runs, and downloads work wherever
the site lets visitors download. An optional account, signed in with a
username and password or with a pasted browser session cookie, adds member
downloads. Token-priced downloads are bought only when the user has turned
them on, only at or below the per-download cap, only after a fresh price quote
from the site, and never twice for the same subtitle.

How the host treats errors shapes the design. Any exception from download()
pauses the whole provider for at least ten minutes and drops it from the rest
of the search run; returning nothing fails without telling the user why. So
search hides candidates the current settings cannot download or pay for, and
download raises a named error only when the user has to act.
